# Hi there 👋 

I'm Anderson Vaz, a software engineer with 20+ years of experience in the industry. 

Solid knowledge design patters, clean code, algorithms, data structures and overall best practices for systems design.

I have solid knowledge in Java and Python and their ecosystem, main libraries and frameworks, and in their evolution. Java I started using from version 1.3, Python from version 2.7 and 3.x and that bit of chaotic transition.
