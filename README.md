# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Anderson Vaz, a software engineer with 17+ years of experience in the industry.
Welcome to my playground. 
Here I collect several small projects that I use to learn new technologies and tools.
There are some forks as well, usually for open source contributions or to keep a copy of a project that I like.
